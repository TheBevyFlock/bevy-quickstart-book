# Player Actions

Until now, we have one system that reacts to all user actions. This doesn't scale well and we will end up with a very long and very complex system.

In this section, you will:

- Learn how to use an input manager
- Learn about triggers and observers

These concepts are essential for creating interactive game elements that respond to player actions.
