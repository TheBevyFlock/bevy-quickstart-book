# Setup

## Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy-quickstart-book
```

## Environment setup

You will need a few things to get started.
This game won't be GPU heavy so most hardware configurations should support running it.

- Install rust: [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Linux

### Windows

If you are instead using Windows, you should be good to go.
