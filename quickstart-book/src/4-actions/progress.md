# Progress Report

## What You've Learned

- How to implement reactivity
  - By using [`Trigger`](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.16.0/bevy/ecs/observer/struct.Trigger.html) and observers
  - Or with optional components to change how an existing query behaves
- How to use an action manager
  - Declaring actions
  - Binding them to inputs
  - And triggering them on entities

## Going Further

- Using [`Component` hooks](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.16.0/bevy/ecs/component/trait.Component.html#adding-components-hooks) to react when a component is added/changed or removed.
